# Click-a-Pokémon App
[Click-a-Pokémon app (https://nameless-garden-27229.herokuapp.com/)

This app uses React to create a game that counts and reacts to user input.

## Object

Using the React library, this componentized app includes JSX, which combines HTML and JavaScript, to create an app with easily reused pieces. No database this time; JavaScript tracks interactions on the front end. 

Once the player clicks on a Pokémon, React reshuffles the 12 images. The goal is to avoid  clicking the same object before reaching 12, which is the maximum score. 

### Making sense of components

Once I had the basic app created, I admit scratching my head about how to create a function that affected elements in one component but displayed in another &mdash; in this case a counter that renders in the header that counts clicks in the main body where the images reside. 

## Technology used

In addition to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my React Click-a-Pokémon app uses ```create-react-app``` and Yarn to keep the app updated in the browser.
